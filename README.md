# My Personal Portfolio

Hi there! I'm Agil Dwiki Yudistira, and this is my portfolio built using Astro, with interactive elements powered by ReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS. This website is a showcase of my work and projects.

## About This Project

This portfolio is designed to be simple yet effective, highlighting my skills and projects in a user-friendly interface. It leverages the efficiency of Astro, the flexibility of ReactJS, and the aesthetics of Tailwind CSS to provide a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Astro**: A modern framework designed for building faster websites with less client-side Javascript.
- **ReactJS**: A robust tool for creating interactive UIs smoothly and efficiently.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly creating custom designs without leaving your HTML.
